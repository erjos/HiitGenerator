//Quick Description of workout structures
//Workouts are made up of Rounds - (1-3 depending on length)
//Each round represents 3 cycles through sets of 3 different workouts (so you complete each workout 9 times in a round)
//One cycle consists of 3 workouts with 30 seconds of rest in between each workout and 45 seconds of work for each excercise
//in between cycles you rest for 1 minute
//then repeat

//in between rounds you rest for 2-3 minutes before starting a new round with new excercises

//to start we'll just make it a standard work/rest time...
//things to customize - shorter/longer rest times in between excercises, sets and cycles... longer work periods?

//Complete workout avtivity
