        //tricky part will be pulling in random assortment of all the different types of workouts - plus we dont really have ones defined as each - we could create a hidden field on each which is like category (1-3) and make sure we have 1 of each category in the workouts...

    //have the ability to customize this later on - add remove workouts that the user doesnt want or like
